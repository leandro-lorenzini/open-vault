## Reporting a Vulnerability

Critical Security vulnerabilities must be reported via e-mail to <leandro.lorenzini@outlook.com>
As this is a new project and there are no other contributors yet, it might take some time to assess every single vulnerability.
If you can submit pull requests with the recommended changes to fix vulnerabilies, feel free to do it.
